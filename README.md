#Problem Definition:
Create a virtual vendening machine. There are a selection of products with a price and a quantity remaining. Users should put in (virtual) money and purchase an item. After they have purchased an item, they can use the remaining money to purchase another item or have the change returned to them. Once they are done they should see a list of the items they have purchased.

#solution:
Solution is largely focussed on front-end.
It is a single page web application developed using angular framework.
Have used JSON server for data collection.
Restful web API services are used to fetch and update data on JSON Server.
moderate use of Bootstrap framework is included.

The solution is divided into 3 components:
1.itemList for managing all the products
2. ShoppingList for display of all the items selected
3. CustomerCheckout for all the checkout operations.


#If I were to spend additional time on the project, I might have done the following:
1.Improved code quality
2.Improved User Interface
3.better error handling,routing methods
4.Added features such as User Login, product list update, addressing security concerns
